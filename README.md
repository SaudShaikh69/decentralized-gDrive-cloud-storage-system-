# Decentralized Image Upload and Sharing

This project facilitates decentralized image upload and sharing on the blockchain using Solidity for the smart contract and React for the front-end interface. It enables users to securely upload images to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and share access with specified users through smart contract functionality.



## Features

- **Decentralized Storage:** Images are uploaded to IPFS, ensuring decentralized and immutable storage.
- **Smart Contract:** Utilizes Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control and ownership management.
- **Access Control:** Users can grant or revoke access to their uploaded images to specific individuals through the smart contract.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity:** Smart contract development for ownership and access control.
- **React:** Front-end interface for uploading images and managing access.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized storage protocol for hosting uploaded images.
